# About Me  

💬 I am Liat Guvenc, a Front End and Fullstack Developer and graduate of the Grace Hopper program.

🍞 I am enthusiastic about learning new technology. During the Grace Hopper Program (September 2021 - December 2021), I learned PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Express, React and React/Redux. For my capstone, Bizarr, I learned React Native, Expo, Firebase and Google Maps API. A solo project I am working on is called Dream-Journal, a fullstack journaling application, where I am implementing Django, Python and React.

🏁 When I'm not programming, I am pushing myself to develop design skills such as, utilizing Adobe Photoshop, Premiere and After Effects and Blender. I am also passionate in learning animation and other sequential art.
